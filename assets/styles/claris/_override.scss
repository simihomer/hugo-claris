// Override Claris theme's  _variables.scss file.
// We recommend not editing this file directly. Instead, create an `assets/sass/_override.scss` file at the root level of your site.
// If you edit this file directly, you will have to resolve git conflicts when and if you decide to pull changes we make on the theme
